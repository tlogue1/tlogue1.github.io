    For assingment: 
        Do a box model on paper to lay out exactly what is needed
        in Header
        #header.bg.top: {backgroung: black}
        #header.bg.bottom: {background garnet}
        #main-header: width 80%, margin: auto (position relative)
        #main-background:
        #main-menu (for the nav on top) (position absolute. right 0)
        university of sc icon - make it into a section with to other inside of it. one is a .columns one for image and one for text
        for search bar - make one section (columnize is and have it be a column with icon and search bar. put the space between)
        left side with nav item - use nav item with horizontal nav
        content on the right hand side - columnized layout 1:2 ratio
        instead of using seciton, make them articles
        another two column layout under the big picture and text
        Footer: similiar to header with three ribbons, grey, garnet, black. outside footer top, middle, nottom
        width 80%, margin auto
        gray part - 2 column layout
        top of red part - 2 columns layout with icon and social media
        bottom of red part - 3 column layout, float 3, float 2, float 1;
        line under you just do <hr> which makes a line go across - make it white. They will all just ahve a title
        within the first three of the columns, you have another div called columns and have three nested sections in each section
        ullli (idk what this is)

        no animations or javascript stuff, lay out mobile first and do the flexing inside media query
        for smaller resolution - make it display none. for larger display block

        section: hover will make a whole section light up when hovering over it.

        Do not need sublists for the left side, just do the Bolded ones
        can use pictures from actual page

        .screenshot {
            max-width:90%; -- this fixes the image and doesnt let it get bigger than 90% of the page
        }

        go to w3 schools and look at flex container
